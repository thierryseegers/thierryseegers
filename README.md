### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been a software developer for about 20 years in Silicon Valley, working in a variety of companies, on diverse projects, ranging from audio for set-top boxes to static network analysis to video-conferencing for mobile platforms. My expertise is in the C++ programming language and whatever else that entails.

In 2019 I moved to France and taught software development to engineering students for two years at [Polytech Marseille](https://polytech.univ-amu.fr/), an experience I loved and wish to renew some day.

I'm currently working on [IMG.LY's Creative SDK](https://img.ly/creative-sdk), a modern design editor you can integrate into your web or mobile app.
